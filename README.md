# two ways binding
try to implement vue2's and vue3's two-way binding on my own 
in order to have a deep understand of two-way binding 


## step by step
1. view changes => data changes
    add a eventListener to view object (like an input element).
2. data changes => view changes
    set setter of data, let the setter function modify the corresponded element
